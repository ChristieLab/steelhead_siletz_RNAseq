# Siletz River RNAseq

## Project description
This project examines the genetic effects of a hatchery on Siletz River steelhead (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*). We performed a series of crosses on adult first-generation hatchery-origin and natural-origin steelhead and conducted RNA-Seq on 120 offspring that we reared in a common garden environment. Information for all sequenced offpsring can be found in Table 1.

## Scripts
Code for the project are split up into directories: 
1. **alignment_and_sorting.** bash scripts for alignment of raw reads
2. **featureCounts.** count transcripts
3. **DEGs.** identify DEGs in main and reciprocal crosses
4. **maternal_effects.** evaluate maternal effects 

  

## Data
All raw data and sample metadata generated for this project are stored in the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) under project PRJNAXXXX (link pending).
